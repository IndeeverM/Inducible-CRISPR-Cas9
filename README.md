The fasta file shows the alignment of thirteen different cytomegalovirus strains. The UGene Pro software is a good visualization tool for the data. Software can be downloaded externally here: http://ugene.net
The uprj file provided also shows the predicted phylogenetic tree of the viruses. 
I used this genome alignment to identify potentially conserved regions in the CMV genome that could be targeting with a CRISPR-Cas9 therapy.
